## Week-1
Below are a series of possible research areas for you to focus on throughout the semester. Note, these are only guides, and can be extended or rethought as necessary:

### Urban Morphology:
How does the width of a neighborhood’s streets, the number of intersections, or the traffic volume affect environmental, economic or social aspects of cities? Urban morphology is the study of urban form, the main physical elements that structure and shape cities such as streets, squares, blocks, plots, and buildings, to answer such questions. Renowned Urban Design professor, Roger Trancik, breaks down the subject of urban morphology into three major subcategories: 1) figure ground, the study of built and unbuilt form, 2) linkage, the study of street and road networks, and 3) place, the study of settlement patterns and urban function. Analysing urban form within these frameworks alongside the use of big data can reveal interesting patterns about places. The study of Urban Morphology has been used to analyse election outcomes like the relationship between voting patterns and urban density. Or solely looking at the similarities and differences between places based on things like the gridedness of streets.

### Cultural Composition:
What does the type of retail establishments tell us about a given neighborhood? What does the distribution of services reveal about urban inequality? Can Airbnb prices tell us anything about neighborhood change or gentrification? These are just a few of the possible questions one could ask by looking at alternative or cultural datasets. When we think about architecture and the built environment our default is to think in terms of the physical characteristics of space and place. But the people that occupy the place and the subsequent cultural inclinations of its inhabitants can reveal hidden patterns that can inform design decisions and function. Looking at a place through a cultural lens (e.g. music, food, consumption, etc) is a rich source of big data and often overlooked in the AEC industry. Examples of urban studies looking at culture have revealed the similarities of places based on the types of artists that play music within them. And have even been early signals for gentrification by looking at the types of complaints people make about local services.

### Health & Environment:
The heath and the environment is a rich area for big data studies. From the relationship between tree cover and income, to the influence of housing density on COVID outcomes, reveals much about the uneven development of cities and the spaces we inhabit. This research area asks one to consider not only the pace and impact of climate change, but how the environment relates to other complex systems like socio economic patterns and even urban morphology. Examples of recent innovative studies looked at whether we can predict the energy use of buildings given its physical characteristics and positioning in the city, studying the sewage system to understand neighborhood health, or quantifying the optimal level of diversity in vegetation.


For next session, pick a research areas to focus on and develop a series of questions you’d like to answer through your semester project. The research and questions should be highly specific and grounded in real world problems. The more specific the idea, the easier it will be to think about possible datasets, quantitative techniques, and a subsequent narrative. Generally, data, analytics and machine learning fall into one of four categories: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive. You should think of your project as falling into one of these areas.

- Descriptive: where you utilize data to describe a given phenomenon
- Diagnostic: where data is used to describe why something happened
- Predictive: where data is used to predict what will happen
- Prescriptive: where data is used to make something happen

For the next session you should present 3 slides stating a series of research questions, a statement (diagrammatic or illustrative) saying why this is important, and links to potential data sources you will use.


Also by next session, ensure you have Python installed on your machine:

- Install Python with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) if using windows
- Install Python with [Homebrew](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-from-homebrew) if using a Mac
- Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account
- Install the [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) text editor
